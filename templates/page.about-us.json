Born from a heartfelt desire to bring joy and long lasting memories to your loved ones. I am Roshni, mum of three and Founder of Little IA. Many people ask me what spurred the desire to create Little IA. And it's actually a funny story. <br\/><br\/>Shortly after my daughter was born, I received the same personalised blanket from four well-meaning friends. But within a few weeks, the blanket was in tatters once it had been washed several times, owing to its poor composition.<br\/><br\/>Determined to create something more enduring, more gentle for delicate newborn skin and more unique, I embarked on a journey to design and create items that parents and children could treasure for many years to come. And our very first collection was released the same week my third child was born. <\/p>",
